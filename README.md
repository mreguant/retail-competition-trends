Description
--------
This repository replicates the results for the paper "Smart Meters and Retail Competition: Trends and Challenges". The code is written in Julia. The main file "main" runs all of the code to generate the data for the 3 figures and 2 tables in the paper.

### Details on each Data Source

### Market share data
> Data on market share were downloaded from CNMC's 2019 Electricity Retail Market Monitoring Report (https://www.cnmc.es/expedientes/isde02720). Data are available from Q1 2011 to Q4 2019. 

Datafiles: `consumer_data.csv`, `traditional_retailers_list.csv`

### Flow data 
> Data on consumers' flow were digitalised from CNMC’s Quarterly Monitoring Reports on Changes of Retailer (https://www.cnmc.es/expedientes?t=IS+SOBRE+CAMBIOS+DE+COMERCIALIZADOR&idambito=All&edit-submit-buscador-expedientes=Buscar&idtipoexp=All&hidprocedim=All). Data are available from Q1 2016 to Q3 2020. 

Datafile: `flow_data.csv`

### Price data 
> Historical data on retail electricity prices were provide by CNMC upon request. A rearranged version of these data are provided as part of this archive. These data are available on a daily basis on the CNCMC's price comparison website (https://comparador.cnmc.gob.es/). Data are available from December 2011 to May 2021. In addition, data on gas prices are from MIBGAS and Bloomberg, and data on retailing costs, from Red Eléctrica de España (REE).  

Datafiles: `monthly_prices.csv`, `natural_gas_prices.dta`, `hourly_retailing_costs.dta`.


### Smart meter data
> Data on smart meter's adoption were digitalised from CNMC's Equipment Integrated in the Remote Management System Reports (https://www.cnmc.es/expedientes?t=TELEGESTION&idambito=All&edit-submit-buscador-expedientes=Buscar&idtipoexp=All&hidprocedim=All). Data are available from July 2015 to December 2019.  

Datafile: `smart_meter.csv`

Description of programs/code
----------------------------

- The program `0_setup.jl` will install all required dependencies in Julia.
- The program `build/code/1_create_market_shares.jl` will compute the market shares based on the number of supply points in each market and tariff.
- The program `build/code/2_create_retailing_costs.jl` will compute the retailing costs for each quarter.
- The program `build/code/3_create_first_stage_dataset.jl` will combine market shares with retail electricity prices, gas prices, retailing costs and smart meter data.
- The program `analysis/code/4_regressions.jl` will compute the regressions in table 1 and 2b.
