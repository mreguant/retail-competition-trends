# Code and data repository for "Smart Meters and Retail Competition: Trends and Challenges"
Authors: Mar Reguant, Jacint Enrich, Ruoyi Li, and Alejandro Mizrahi

Description
--------
This repository replicates the results for the paper "Smart Meters and Retail Competition: Trends and Challenges". The code is written in Julia. The file "main_windows" or "main_macOS" runs all of the code to generate the 2 figures and 2 tables in the paper. Because price data are confidential, this repository replicates the results without them.

### Details on each Data Source

#### Market share data
> Data on market shares were downloaded from CNMC's 2019 Electricity Retail Market Monitoring Report (https://www.cnmc.es/expedientes/isde02720). Data are available from Q1 2011 to Q4 2019. 

Datafiles: `consumer_data.csv`, `traditional_retailers_list.csv`.

#### Flow data 
> Data on consumers' flows were digitalised from CNMCâ€™s Quarterly Monitoring Reports on Changes of Retailer (https://www.cnmc.es/expedientes?t=IS+SOBRE+CAMBIOS+DE+COMERCIALIZADOR&idambito=All&edit-submit-buscador-expedientes=Buscar&idtipoexp=All&hidprocedim=All). Data are available from Q1 2016 to Q3 2020. 

Datafile: `flow_data.csv`.


#### Smart meter data
> Data on smart meter's adoption were digitalised from CNMC's Equipment Integrated in the Remote Management System Reports (https://www.cnmc.es/expedientes?t=TELEGESTION&idambito=All&edit-submit-buscador-expedientes=Buscar&idtipoexp=All&hidprocedim=All). Data are available from July 2015 to December 2019.  

Datafile: `smart_meter.csv`.


#### Price data

### Memory and Runtime Requirements

#### Summary

Approximate time needed to reproduce the analyses on a standard 2022 desktop machine:

- [ ] <10 minutes
- [x] 10-60 minutes
- [ ] 1-8 hours
- [ ] 8-24 hours
- [ ] 1-3 days
- [ ] 3-14 days

- [ ] Not feasible to run on a desktop machine, as described below.

#### Details

The code was last run on a **11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-1135G with Windows 10 Pro**. 


Description of programs/code
----------------------------

- The code `0_setup.jl` installs all required dependencies in Julia.
- The code `build/code/1_create_data_sets.jl` generates the data sets for the choice search model and the regressions.
- The code `analysis/code/2_analysis.jl` computes the calibration in table 1 and the regressions in table 2b. 
- The code `analysis/code/3_plots.jl` generates the figures 1a and 2a.

Instructions to Replicators
---------------------------

- Run `main_windows.bat` (for Windows users) or `main_macOS.sh` (for MAC OS users) to generate all the outputs sequencially. To run Julia from the command line, add Julia to the PATH environment variable. See https://julialang.org/downloads/platform.
